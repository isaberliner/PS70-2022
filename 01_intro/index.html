 ### <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Week 1: Introduction </h3>

 <h3 style="color: white; background-color:#2488CA;">Final Project Proposal:</h1>
<p style="color: black; background-color:#6EDCF7;">For my final project, I am interested in developing an assistive technology, either for helping create art or for helping transport items. Both these ideas are currently quite general and vague as I am very unsure what is possible or practical. </p>
  <h4>Idea 1: Assistive Painting Device</h4> 

<p style="color:black; background-color:#6EDCF7;"> I’m curious to explore making a tool that can help make precise markings on a canvas or paper, with the markings being either pre-programmed by the user or controlled live on some sort of trackpad. From my own personal experience making art, I often struggle to make smaller, more detailed marks because of weakness in my arms and a tremor in my hands. My hope is that this machine or tool could mimic the control and precision of digital art on a physical surface, allowing artists with physical disabilities to realize their artistic visions without the limitations imposed by their physical capacity. I imagine it would be more challenging to work with paint and paintbrushes rather than pens, pencils, or markers, but I do want to look into how feasible it would be to work with paint. I wasn’t able to find a specific similar project though I read articles that describe various assistive art making technologies so I know there is a foundation for these kinds of projects that I can research further. Professor Melenbrink’s wall plotter also makes me think this kind of precision is possible. To start, I could focus on the machine being able to make clean lines, circles, or other geometric shapes but with exact size and placement being easily controlled by the user.   </p>

  <h4>Idea 2: Self-Following Rolling Backpack</h4>

<p style="color:black; background-color:#6EDCF7;"> This idea is somewhat less detailed, but I’m interested in developing a device that can carry books and other items typically stored in a backpack without requiring the user to lift the storage device. I know there are lots of machines like this in existence (like self following suitcases) but I’d want to focus on the practicality of using one of these machines on Harvard’s campus, accounting for the varying ground surfaces that might pose a problem for existing versions of these devices (for example all the uneven red brick) as well as making it smaller and more discrete. This idea is inspired by my AEO advisor suggesting I use a rolling backpack on campus because it’s difficult for me to carry my things in traditional bags/backpacks (a suggestion I was not eager to follow but would certainly make a big difference in my pain management). If at all possible, I would also be curious if there are any ways to make this device more able to go up small flights of stairs (or at least distribute weight in such a way that it is easier to lift at necessary moments).
